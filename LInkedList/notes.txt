1. linked lists make use of nodes that form a chain
2. so use node as a seperate entity so that it can be reused 
3. a linked list has head, tail pointers and the length
4. operations that are to be performed are: push, pop, unshift, shift, get, set, insert, remove and reverse.
5. usually these are unidirectional

Pushing:
1. create a new node
2. append it to the end
3. change the tail pointer to the one pushed last.
